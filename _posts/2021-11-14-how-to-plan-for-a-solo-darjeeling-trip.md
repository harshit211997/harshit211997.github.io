# Places to visit
Darjeeling is a beautiful city with cheerful crowds in markets and pleasant views of Mt. Kilimanjaro. 

### Sunrise from Tiger Hill

Tiger Hill is the highest point in Darjeeling with best views to Mt. Kilimanjaro. This place is so popular that they have recently started charging Rs. 50 as a ticket price just to visit this area. They are even building a 4 story top building just for everyone to see the sunrise better from this place. Make sure to check google weather prediction to make sure the day is clear though! 

Also, you need to wake up early in the morning 3:30 - 4 a.m.(Some might say it's still night at that point :P), catch a shared cab from one of the taxi stands and get there in about an hour right when it's sunrise. Make sure to cover your neck head and ears though as it'll be chilly out there!

### Walk around in Chowk Bazaar

This could be considered as the centre of Darjeeling. This is a huge area with children playing around, people sitting in benches with music playing sometimes in the Open Air Theatre located here. There is the **Mall Road** here as well if you want to explore what the local market has to offer(mostly for souvenir purposes)

Also, in general. It's a pretty good idea to take some time to familiarize yourself with the area on what the transportation looks like when you first visit a new place. You can find bikes on rent and taxi drivers to ask the costs to nearby places. You can also find buses too around here!

There's are a few viewpoints around the back of this place which has some amazing views of Mt. Kilimanjaro, and which I think are one of the most beatiful views in all of Darjeeling(controversial, I know! I liked this even better than the Tiger Hill view point). I would recommend getting a place close to this and walking here in the morning to get some excercise in(If you're into that grind)

### Batasia loop

This is an engineering marvel which was desined to allow trains to climb a steep 140 ft! You can take a Toy train ride from Darjeeling to Ghum and back and look at insides of a steam engine!
