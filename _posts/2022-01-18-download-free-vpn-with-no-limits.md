Today I am offering a free vpn to whoever contacts me via the **Contact** button at the top of this page! 

I have basically set up a vpn server through my azure account using [algo vpn](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo) which allows for up to 65k users. Since I have the credits for free through my Visual Studio Enterperise subscription, I thought why not share this server with other users! The vpn server is present in **UK South** and it offers me a pretty good bandwidth(about 30 mbps)

Without the vpn I usually get about 35-40 mbps. There are other free vpn services that you can use, although in pretty much all those cases, you either get a limited data or the bandwidth is too low or both. So, you can basically overcome those limits using this server.

### Will you be monitoring my data?
Short answer is no, since I am using algo vpn for setting up the vpn server, there's no way to actually even monitor user activity(See [this](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo/blob/master/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-monitor-user-activity) for more details)


### I am in, where do I sign up!
If you're interested, just click the **Contact** button at the top and send me a request saying you need access to this vpn server. I'll send you the QR code and configuration file via mail which will be needed to connect to the server and you can use [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/)(available on android, windows, mac and iOS) to connect to the vpn server. It's pretty easy actually.
